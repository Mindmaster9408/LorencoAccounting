# Admin Dashboard

This project is a modern web-based admin dashboard for managing user app activation status. It allows an admin to view all users and their apps, and deactivate apps for users who have not paid. Built with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend, using MongoDB for data storage. Includes authentication for admin access and is designed for easy integration with other apps via API.
